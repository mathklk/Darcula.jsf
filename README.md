# DarculaJSF

This is a replication of PyCharm's "Darcula" color scheme as a .jsf file. It can be used with any editor supporting .jsf syntax files,
 namely [Joe's  Own Editor](https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/) from where the fileformat originates and [NE, the NiceEditor](https://github.com/vigna/ne).

Additionally to adjusting the colors, I added the Builtin-functions as a new category of keywords for seperate highliting and made a few other changes to match PyCharm's scheme as closely as possible.

# How to use
Download the file `python.jsf` from this repository and copy it into the syntax folder, overwriting the default `python.jsf` file. 
By default this path is `/usr/share/ne/syntax/`.
